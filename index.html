            <p class="ellipsis">Cacti are native through most of the length of North and South America, from British Columbia and Alberta southward; the southernmost limit of their range extends far into Chile and Argentina. Mexico has the greatest number and variety of species.
              The only cacti possibly native to the Old World are members of the tropical genus Rhipsalis, occurring in East Africa, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka.

            <h1>Mohave</h1>
            <p class="ellipsis">Cacti are succulent perennial plants. Although a few species inhabit tropical or subtropical areas, most live in and are well adapted to dry regions. Cacti generally have thick herbaceous or woody chlorophyll-containing stems. In most species
              leaves are either absent or greatly reduced, minimizing the amount of surface area from which water can be lost, and the stem has taken over the photosynthetic functions of the plant. Only the tropical genera Pereskia and Pereskopsis, both vines,
              have conventional-looking functional leaves, while the leaves of the Andean Maihuenia are rounded, not flattened. The root systems are generally thin, fibrous, and shallow, ranging widely to absorb superficial moisture.</p>

            <h1>Gobi</h1>
            <p class="ellipsis">Cacti vary greatly in size and general appearance, from buttonlike peyote (Lophophora) and low clumps of prickly pear (Opuntia) and hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus) to the upright columns of barrel cacti (Ferocactus and Echinocactus) and the imposing
              saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea). Most cacti grow in the ground, but several tropical species—including leaf cactus (Epiphyllum), Rhipsalis, and Schlumbergera—are epiphytes, growing on other plants; others live on hard substrates such as rocks,
              while yet others climb far up trees. Epiphytic species tend to have thin, almost leaflike flattened stems. The appearance of the plant varies also according to whether the stem surface is smooth or ornamented with protruding tubercles, ridges,
              or grooves.</p>

            <p class="ellipsis">Cacti are widely cultivated as ornamentals. In addition, various species, notably prickly pears and chollas (both Opuntia), are cultivated as food. In South America species of Opuntia, Cereus, and others are used as living fences, and wood from
              columnar cacti is used as fuel in some desert regions. Barrel cacti (Echinocactus and Ferocactus) are a source of water in emergencies. Peyote, from Lophophora williamsii, has been used ceremonially since pre-Columbian times for its hallucinogenic
              properties.</p>
